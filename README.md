# cli_read_write_csv
Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI) script that reads a local CSV and writes a modified version back to disk with a new name

## Background
This repository is intended to be used as a template for development of CLI packages.  Main.py holds the primary code and is the entry point of the script.  Utils.py contains functions.  Config.py contains configuration items.  It includes a separate 'data' directory containing input data.  This repo has only been tested on Windows OS.
